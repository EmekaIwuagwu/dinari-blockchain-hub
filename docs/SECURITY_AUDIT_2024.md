**Assessment:** Code cannot be built without fixing compilation errors.

---

## TODO Items

### Found: 1 TODO Comment

**Location:** `src/crypto/hash.cpp:4`
```cpp
// TODO: Migrate to EVP API in future
```

**Impact:** Using deprecated OpenSSL APIs with known security implications.

**Recommendation:** High priority migration required.

---

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (MUST FIX)

### 1. Integer Overflow - Unlimited Coin Creation

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/core/transaction.cpp:238-246`
**CVE-Level Impact:** Fund creation/theft

**Vulnerability:**
```cpp
Amount totalOut = 0;
for (const auto& output : outputs) {
    totalOut += output.value;  // ‚ùå No overflow check before addition
    if (!MoneyRange(totalOut)) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Exploit:** Attacker creates transaction with outputs that overflow uint64_t, bypassing MoneyRange check and minting unlimited coins.

**Fix Required:**
```cpp
Amount totalOut = 0;
for (const auto& output : outputs) {
    if (!SafeAdd(totalOut, output.value, totalOut)) {
        return false;  // Overflow detected
    }
    if (!MoneyRange(totalOut)) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

---

### 2. UTXO Double-Spend via Blockchain Reorg

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/core/utxo.cpp:126-132`

**Vulnerability:** ApplyTransaction removes UTXOs without atomic update, allowing same UTXO to be spent twice during reorganization.

**Impact:** Complete loss of blockchain consensus, double-spending attacks.

**Fix Required:** Implement atomic UTXO set updates with rollback capability.

---

### 3. Private Key Memory Exposure

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/wallet/keystore.cpp:398`, `src/crypto/ecdsa.cpp:88`

**Vulnerability:** Private keys stored in regular memory without secure wiping.

**Exploit:**
- Memory dumps expose keys
- Cold boot attacks recover keys
- Swap file contains keys
- Core dumps leak keys

**Fix Required:**
```cpp
// Use secure memory allocation
void SecureWipe(void* ptr, size_t len) {
    volatile unsigned char* p = static_cast<volatile unsigned char*>(ptr);
    while (len--) *p++ = 0;
}

// Or use sodium_memzero() from libsodium
```

---

### 4. Buffer Overflow in Network Message Parsing

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/network/message.cpp:218-223`

**Vulnerability:** Unchecked buffer access during script deserialization.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Fix Required:** Add comprehensive bounds checking before all buffer operations.

---

### 5. RPC Authentication Bypass

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/rpc/rpcserver.cpp:393-395`

**Vulnerability:**
```cpp
} else if (!config.rpcPassword.empty()) {
    return "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized...";
}
// ‚ùå If rpcPassword is empty, authentication is skipped
```

**Exploit:** Access all RPC functions without credentials if password not configured.

**Fix Required:** Enforce authentication always, fail closed on empty password.

---

### 6. Memory Leak in ECDSA Operations

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/crypto/ecdsa.cpp:92`

**Vulnerability:** BIGNUM pointer allocated but never freed on error path.

**Impact:** Repeated operations exhaust memory ‚Üí DoS

**Fix Required:** Implement RAII wrapper for OpenSSL objects or use smart pointers.

---

### 7. JSON Injection in RPC

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/rpc/rpcserver.cpp:171-209`

**Vulnerability:** Naive string-based JSON parsing without validation.

**Exploit:** Inject malicious JSON to execute arbitrary commands.

**Fix Required:** Use proper JSON library (nlohmann/json, rapidjson).

---

### 8. Master Key Memory Leak

**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL
**Location:** `src/wallet/keystore.cpp:109-112`

**Vulnerability:** Destructor clears masterKey but exception paths don't.

**Impact:** Master key remains in memory after errors, compromising wallet encryption.

**Fix Required:** Use RAII pattern for secure memory cleanup.

---

## High Severity Vulnerabilities (SHOULD FIX)

### 9. Division by Zero in Fee Calculation

**Location:** `src/core/mempool.cpp:48`
```cpp
Amount feeRate = fee / tx.GetSize();  // ‚ùå No check if GetSize() == 0
```

### 10. Weak PBKDF2 Iterations

**Location:** `src/wallet/keystore.cpp:343`
```cpp
return crypto::Hash::PBKDF2_SHA512(passphraseBytes, salt, 100000, 32);
// ‚ùå Should be 310,000+ iterations per OWASP 2023
```

### 11. Unbounded Stack Growth in Script Engine

**Location:** `src/core/script.cpp:340`
- No maximum stack depth limit
- Malicious script can cause stack overflow

### 12. Connection Slot Exhaustion

**Location:** `src/network/node.cpp:364-369`
- Race condition allows exceeding max connections
- DoS through connection flooding

### 13. Insufficient RPC Rate Limiting

**Location:** `src/rpc/rpcserver.cpp:424-431`
- 10 requests per 60 seconds = 14,400 attempts/day
- Insufficient for brute force protection

## Honest Assessment for Investors

### Current State: ALPHA SOFTWARE

**Risk Level:** üî¥ **EXTREME**

### What This Means:

1. **Technology is Incomplete:** Core components don't compile
2. **Security is Insufficient:** 8 critical exploitable flaws
3. **NOT Safe for Real Value:** Funds could be stolen or lost
4. **Requires Significant Work:** Months of development needed

### Investment Implications:

- **Early Stage:** Technology demonstration, not production system
- **High Risk:** Security vulnerabilities could cause total loss
- **Development Stage:** Requires expert security review and fixes
- **Timeline Uncertain:** 3-6 months minimum to production readiness

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Do NOT deploy with real value** until all CRITICAL issues fixed
2. **Hire security experts** for professional audit
3. **Extensive testing** on testnet before mainnet
4. **Bug bounty program** to find remaining issues
5. **Gradual rollout** with limited value at risk
