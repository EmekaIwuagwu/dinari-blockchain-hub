## Proof of Work Mathematics

Dinari Blockchain implements a **Bitcoin-style Proof of Work (PoW)** consensus mechanism that requires miners to solve a computationally intensive mathematical problem to create new blocks.

### The Mathematical Problem

Miners must find a **nonce** value such that when combined with the block header and double-hashed with SHA-256, the resulting hash is **numerically less than** a target value:

```
Double-SHA-256(BlockHeader) < Target
```

Where:
- **BlockHeader** contains: `version`, `previousBlockHash`, `merkleRoot`, `timestamp`, `bits`, and **nonce**
- **Double-SHA-256** means: `SHA-256(SHA-256(data))`
- **Target** is derived from the difficulty encoded in `bits`

### The Computational Challenge

```cpp
// The mining loop (simplified)
for (nonce = 0; nonce < MAX_NONCE; nonce++) {
    blockHeader.nonce = nonce;
    hash = SHA256(SHA256(blockHeader));

    if (hash < target) {
        // Solution found! Block is valid.
        return SUCCESS;
    }
}
```

**Key Properties:**
- **One-way function**: SHA-256 is cryptographically secure and cannot be reversed
- **Brute force required**: The only way to find a solution is to try different nonce values
- **Probability-based**: Each hash attempt has a probability of `1 / (2^256 / target)` of success
- **Difficulty tunable**: By adjusting the target, we control how hard the problem is

### Target Calculation from Bits

The target is encoded in a **compact representation** called "bits" (4 bytes):

```
bits = 0xAABBCCDD
     = [exponent: AA] [mantissa: BBCCDD]

Target = mantissa × 2^(8 × (exponent - 3))
```

**Example:**
```
bits = 0x1d00ffff  (Genesis difficulty)
exponent = 0x1d = 29
mantissa = 0x00ffff = 65535

Target = 65535 × 2^(8 × (29 - 3))
       = 65535 × 2^208
       = 0x00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

### Difficulty and Target Relationship

**Difficulty** is inversely proportional to the target:

```
Difficulty = MAX_TARGET / Current_TARGET

MAX_TARGET = 2^224 - 1  (the easiest possible difficulty)
```

**Relationship:**
- **Higher difficulty** → **Lower target** → **Fewer valid hashes** → **Harder to find**
- **Lower difficulty** → **Higher target** → **More valid hashes** → **Easier to find**

### Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm

To maintain a **consistent 10-minute block time**, difficulty adjusts every **2,016 blocks** (approximately 2 weeks):

```
Actual_Timespan = Time(Last_Block) - Time(First_Block_In_Period)
Target_Timespan = 2016 blocks × 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes

New_Difficulty = Current_Difficulty × (Target_Timespan / Actual_Timespan)
```

**Adjustment Limits:**
- Maximum adjustment: **4x easier** or **4x harder** per period
- This prevents drastic difficulty changes from large hashrate fluctuations

**Formula Implementation:**
```cpp
// If blocks took longer than expected (network slower)
if (actualTimespan > targetTimespan) {
    // Make mining EASIER (increase target, decrease difficulty)
    adjustment = min(actualTimespan / targetTimespan, 4.0);
    newTarget = currentTarget × adjustment;
}
// If blocks came faster than expected (network faster)
else {
    // Make mining HARDER (decrease target, increase difficulty)
    adjustment = min(targetTimespan / actualTimespan, 4.0);
    newTarget = currentTarget / adjustment;
}
```

### Mining Probability and Expected Time

For a given hash rate `H` (hashes per second) and difficulty `D`:

```
Expected_Time_To_Find_Block = (D × 2^32) / H

Example:
- Difficulty: 1,000,000
- Hash Rate: 1 TH/s (1,000,000,000,000 H/s)
- Expected Time: (1,000,000 × 4,294,967,296) / 1,000,000,000,000
                ≈ 4,295 seconds ≈ 71.6 minutes
```

### Multi-Threaded Mining

Dinari implements **parallel mining** by distributing the nonce search space:

```
Total_Nonce_Space = 2^32 (4,294,967,296 possible values)

For N threads:
- Thread 0: nonces [0 to 2^32/N - 1]
- Thread 1: nonces [2^32/N to 2×2^32/N - 1]
- Thread N-1: nonces [(N-1)×2^32/N to 2^32 - 1]
```

Each thread independently searches its range, maximizing CPU utilization.

### Verification

Any node can **instantly verify** a block's proof of work:

```cpp
bool VerifyProofOfWork(BlockHeader header) {
    Hash256 hash = SHA256(SHA256(header));
    Hash256 target = BitsToTarget(header.bits);

    return (hash < target);  // Simple comparison
}
```

**Asymmetric cost:**
- **Finding** a valid nonce: Computationally expensive (millions/billions of hashes)
- **Verifying** a valid nonce: Trivial (one hash + comparison)

### Security Guarantees

The Proof of Work system provides:

1. **Sybil Resistance**: Creating blocks requires real computational work, not just identities
2. **Economic Security**: Attacking the network requires >51% of total hash power
3. **Consensus Formation**: The longest chain (most accumulated work) wins
4. **Immutability**: Rewriting history requires redoing all proof of work

### Mathematical Security Properties

```
Work_In_Block = 2^256 / Target

Total_Chain_Work = Σ Work_In_Block_i  (sum of all blocks)

To_Rewrite_N_Blocks = Must_Redo_Work(N) + Maintain_Lead
                    = Requires > 51% sustained hash rate
```

**Attack Cost:**
```
Cost_To_Attack = (Hash_Rate_Required × Time × Energy_Cost)
                + (Hardware_Investment)

For a 51% attack on a network with 100 TH/s:
- Need: 51 TH/s sustained
- Time: Hours to days (depending on depth)
- Energy: Megawatts
- Hardware: Millions of dollars in mining equipment
```

- **Difficulty Adjustment**: `src/consensus/difficulty.cpp` (lines 15-110)

bool Hash::CheckProofOfWork(const Hash256& hash, uint32_t target);

// Target calculation

  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getblockchaininfo","params":[],"id":1}'
```

**Get Transaction by Hash (Explorer API):**
```bash
curl -u user:pass http://localhost:9334 \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getrawtransaction","params":["<txid>",true],"id":1}'
```

**List Recent Blocks (Explorer API):**
```bash
curl -u user:pass http://localhost:9334 \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"listblocks","params":[0,10],"id":1}'
```

**Send Transaction:**
```bash
curl -u user:pass http://localhost:9334 \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"sendtoaddress","params":["D1abc...",100.0],"id":1}'
```

For complete API documentation with all methods, see [docs/POSTMAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/POSTMAN_API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Security

The Dinari blockchain has been designed and hardened with security as the absolute top priority. All critical vulnerabilities identified in the security audit have been fixed.

### Security Features

- ✅ Memory-safe C++ practices (RAII, smart pointers)
- ✅ **Cryptographically secure random number generation (OpenSSL RAND_bytes)**
- ✅ **Constant-time operations in authentication (timing attack prevention)**
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- ✅ AES-256-CBC encryption for wallet data
- ✅ Thread-safe operations with mutex protection
- ✅ **DoS protection (rate limiting, IP banning, connection limits)**
- ✅ Private key wiping from memory
- ✅ Signature verification for all transactions
- ✅ **Transaction validation before network relay**
- ✅ **Peer misbehavior scoring and automatic banning**
- ✅ **Integer overflow protection with safe arithmetic**
- ✅ **Multi-script type validation (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH)**
- ✅ **Wallet auto-lock with configurable timeout**
- ✅ **Zero TODO items in codebase (all implemented or documented)**

### Security Audit Status

| Vulnerability | Severity | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Main application integration | CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED |
| RPC authentication bypass | CRITICAL | ✅ FIXED |
| Weak wallet encryption RNG | HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| No transaction validation | HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| No peer banning system | HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| Incomplete UTXO validation | HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| No wallet auto-lock | HIGH | ✅ FIXED |
| Integer overflow risks | HIGH | ✅ FIXED |

A comprehensive security audit covering 13 major categories is available in [docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md](docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md).

**Note:** While all identified vulnerabilities have been addressed, a professional third-party security audit is strongly recommended before mainnet deployment.
